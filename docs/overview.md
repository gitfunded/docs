## Why GitFunded?

---
Internet has provided a great way to collaborate for profit or non profit. It surely paved a way
for so many ideas to turn into actual products that made our lives easier. But just an open network cannot help every innovations to come to light.
May be due to lack of reach or lack of trust to take an idea to a higher grounds. 

We wanted to create a platform where it is convenient for
any project to reach out to the masses and **get funded** and also keep the project supporters in a loop about the progress.

## What is GitFunded?

GitFunded aims to provided a sustainable funding for open source software (OSS)
community. It tries to overcome some of the issues in the existing funding, bounty platform with the help of decentralized system.

Although we initially integrated the funding solution for GitHub, we look forward to more integrations and reach a wider
developer community.

## Literature review

Existing solutions for funding public goods (developers, maintainers, promoters) in Ethereum community:

* [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)
* [MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com/)
* [Bounty Network](https://bounties.network/)
* [Democracy Earth](https://democracy.earth/)

Existing solutions for funding the open source community:

* [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)

### How GitFunded is different?

* None of the grant platforms on Ethereum keep track of how the grant funds are spent 
* So, GitFunded is not just a grant or bounty platform but also an issue tracker and governance platform

Following features summarize GitFended's approach to fund and govern the open source projects.

### GitFunded features

* Create a project (GitHub) to get funded
    * Tell about the project, organization.
    * Define admins, and toe
    * Set the budget for the project

* Sponsor any of the public projects (One time/ recurring)
* Create issues/ tasks for the project and attach bounty
    * Create a new task or select an existing task and attach the bounty
    *  Mention the acceptance criteria (Number of votes, deadline)

* Create expenses to maintain the project
    * Add founders fees
    * Add any expense of the project and get it approved from the community
    
* Post events and updates
    * Announce conferences, workshops, meetups
    
* Integration with DAO smart contracts
    
* Assist to Exchange currencies and file taxes
    * Integrating exchanges and accounting assists

## Highlights

* Easy onboading
