## Why GitFunded?

---
Internet has provided a great way to collaborate for profit or non profit. But it surely paved a way
for so many ideas to turn into actual products that made our lives easier. But also it doesn't help every innovations.
May be due to lack of reach or lack of trust to take an idea to the next level. We wanted to create a platform where it is convenient for
a project to reach out to the masses and **get funded** and also keep the project supporters in loop about the progress.

## What is GitFunded?

GitFunded aims to provided a sustainable funding for open source software (OSS)
community. It tries to overcome some of the issues with the existing funding, bounties platform with the help of decentralized system.

Although we have integrated the funding solution for GitHub as of now, we look forward to more integration to reach wider
developer community.
