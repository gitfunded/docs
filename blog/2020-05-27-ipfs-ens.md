Ever wondered how to host a website without a server or domain name? Here is a treat for you then...

<!--truncate-->

Everyone who maintains an online portfolio will eventually maintain their on website to maintain all their 
resources at one place. There are plenty of ways to create and host static websites freely on the internet 
using different platforms. Hosting a website essentially requires a web hosting platform and a domain name bought
from registrars such as **GoDaddy**, **NameCheap**, **BigRock** etc. We being an advocate of decentralization and censorship 
resistant are in search of purely decentralized way of hosting a web application. That's what we will discuss in this
article by deploying a static website using IPFS and ENS.

We will cover the following topics. Feel free to skip the topics you are already familiar with:

1. **IPFS** and **ENS**
2. Registering and managing an ENS domain
3. Hosting a static site with IPFS
4. IPFS and IPNS
5. Linking the hosted IPFS site to the ENS domain

##  Introducing IPFS and ENS

**Inter Planetary File System** or IPFS is a distributed file system where file is stored on a network of computers that
communicate with each other rather than storing it on a single server. More details on IPFS can be found [here](https://simpleaswater.com/ipfs/).

**Ethereum Name Service** is a distributed, open naming system on Ethereum blockchain. Just like domain names in the web
standards, ENS's job is to map human-readable names like `alice.eth` to Ethereum addresses (Ex: `0xd5B5Ff46dEB4baA8a096DD0267C3b81Bda65e943`) or 
IPFS content hashes (Ex: ipfs://QmQToNGFsGMkQe76mRirCvRykJSiRB1JPpRLumyMN7N67T). Although it can map to machine readable
addresses and contents, they cannot map names directly to the ANAME or CNAME unless we use bridges like EthDNS. We will
discuss about EthDNS in a while after we create our first ENS domain.

## Registering and managing an ENS domain

We often get a domain before we work on a project so that we can host all the resources in the future. Registering a domain
name is the simplest step of the entire process. We shall do the same thing but with the ENS. This is process is as simple
as registering a domain name using GoDadday. Probably much simpler than that since all we need is a Ethereum wallet extension such 
as MetaMask with some funds. For simplicity we will use **Ropsten** test network for domain registration.

1. Unlike domain name registration there is a single ENS registrar maintained at https://app.ens.domains, although it may
have different clients ([MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/category/ens)). We will refer to this
as ENS app throughout this post.
Make sure to set the network on MetaMask to Ropsten before visiting https://app.ens.domains.

2. In the home page of the ENS app search the required name. In my case it is `koshik.eth`. It will then take you
to the registration page if the desired name is available.

:::info
Currently, ENS mainnet has only `.eth` as the top level domain. So, you won't be able to register a name with any other TLD as of now.

:::

3. A regular name on ENS costs **$5** (Around 0.024 at the time of writing) for a year unlike 10 dollar domains for web. 
Although the user doesn't have to provide any more details, 2 transactions need to be passed to the Ethereum blockchain.  

![ens-register](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-register.png)

4. The first transaction transaction is to reserve the ENS name. This transaction is created as soon as the <Highlight color="#1877F2">**Request to Register** </Highlight> 
 button is clicked. Make sure to pay enough GAS for the transaction (Set the GAS price to atleast 30 GWEI) to make sure you don't lose your ENS name.

:::note
After the first transaction is confirmed, there is a waiting period of one minute to make sure that multiple people do not
register for the same name.

5. The second and the final transaction will register the ENS name and transfer the ownership to the current logged in 
    user account in the MetaMask. The transaction will be created as soon as the <Highlight color="#1877F2">**Register**</Highlight> button is clicked.
    
    Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a unique ENS name :clap::clap::clap:

6. Once the transaction is confirmed, we can now access the the details and manage page of the ENS name. You can reach this page by 
    either going to `My Names` tab or simply searching for the newly registered name.
    
    The _Controller_ and _Registrant_ will be set to the registered used address by default. The _Resolver_ is a special contract which 
    handles ENS name resolution.
    
    :::note
    By default the ENS name will point to the registered user address. In my case, `koshik.eth` will poin to `0x958543756A4c7AC6fB361f0efBfeCD98E4D297Db`
    :::
    
    We can create any number of subdomains just like web domain addresses. We will use subdomains concept to point to our static 
    website using IPFS at later stage. We have now completed the first part of our mission.
