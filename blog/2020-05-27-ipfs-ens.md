Ever wondered how to host a website without a server or purchasing a domain name? Here is a treat for you then...

<!--truncate-->

Everyone who has an online portfolio will eventually manage their on website to maintain all their 
resources at one place. There are plenty of ways to create and host static websites freely on the internet 
using different platforms. Hosting a website essentially requires a web hosting platform and a domain name bought
from registrars such as **GoDaddy**, **NameCheap**, **BigRock** etc. We being an advocate of decentralization and censorship 
resistant network are in search of purely decentralized way of hosting a web application. That's what we will discuss in this
article by deploying a static website using IPFS and ENS.

We will cover the following topics. Feel free to skip the topics you are already familiar with:

1. **IPFS** and **ENS**
2. Registering and managing an ENS domain
3. Hosting a static site with IPFS
4. Linking the hosted IPFS site to the ENS domain

##  Introducing IPFS and ENS

Before we get into the depths of the technologies, let's try to define them first:

**Inter Planetary File System** or IPFS is a distributed file system where file is stored on a network of computers that
communicate with each other rather than storing it on a single server. More details on IPFS can be found [here](https://simpleaswater.com/ipfs/).

![IPFS](/img/ipfs-ens/IPFS.jpg)

**Ethereum Name Service** is a distributed, open naming system on Ethereum blockchain. Just like domain names in the web
standards, ENS's job is to map human-readable names like `alice.eth` to Ethereum addresses (Ex: `0xd5B5Ff46dEB4baA8a096DD0267C3b81Bda65e943`) or 
IPFS content hashes (Ex: ipfs://QmQToNGFsGMkQe76mRirCvRykJSiRB1JPpRLumyMN7N67T). Although it can map to machine readable
addresses and contents, they cannot map names directly to the ANAME or CNAME unless we use bridges like EthDNS. We will
discuss about EthDNS in a while after we create our first ENS domain.

## Registering and managing an ENS domain

We often get a domain before we work on a project so that we can host all the resources in the future. Registering a domain
name is the simplest step of the entire process. We shall do the same thing but with the ENS. This process is as simple
as registering a domain name using GoDadday. Probably much simpler than that since all we need is a Ethereum wallet extension such 
as MetaMask with some funds. Although we will be using MainNet in this article feel free to use **Ropsten** test network for domain registration.

:::caution
Although you can register a name using Ethereum test network such as Ropsten, you won't be able to use it to deploy IPFS sites since
the integration is only supported on MainNet.
:::

1. Unlike domain name registration there is a single ENS registrar maintained at https://app.ens.domains, although it may
    have different clients ([MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/category/ens)). We will refer to this
    as ENS app throughout this post.
    Make sure to set the network on MetaMask to Ropsten if you are planning to use testnet before visiting https://app.ens.domains.

2. In the home page of the ENS app search the required name. In my case it is `koshik.eth`. It will then take you
    to the registration page if the desired name is available.

    ![ens-home](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-home.png)

:::info
Currently, ENS mainnet has only `.eth` as the top level domain. So, you won't be able to register a name with any other TLD as of now.

:::

3. A regular name on ENS costs **$5** (Around 0.024 at the time of writing) for a year unlike 10 dollar domains for web. 
    Although the user doesn't have to provide any more details, 2 transactions need to be passed to the Ethereum blockchain.  

    ![ens-register](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-register.png)

4. The first transaction transaction is to reserve the ENS name. This transaction is created as soon as the <Highlight color="#1877F2">**Request to Register** </Highlight> 
    button is clicked. Make sure to pay enough GAS for the transaction (Set the GAS price to atleast 30 GWEI) to make sure you don't lose your ENS name.

    ![ens-txn1](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-txn1.png)

:::note
After the first transaction is confirmed, there is a waiting period of one minute to make sure that multiple people do not
register for the same name.
:::

![ens-txn-wait](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-txn-wait.png)

5. The second and the final transaction will register the ENS name and transfer the ownership to the current logged in 
    user account in the MetaMask. The transaction will be created as soon as the <Highlight color="#1877F2">**Register**</Highlight> button is clicked.
    
    Congratulations, you are now the proud owner of a unique ENS name :clap::clap::clap:
    
    ![ens-txn2](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-txn2.png)

6. Once the transaction is confirmed, we can now access the the details and manage page of the ENS name. You can reach this page by 
    either going to `My Names` tab or simply searching for the newly registered name.
    
    The _Controller_ and _Registrant_ will be set to the registered used address by default. The _Resolver_ is a special contract which 
    handles ENS name resolution.
    
    :::note
    By default the ENS name will point to the registered user address. In my case, `koshik.eth` will poin to `0x958543756A4c7AC6fB361f0efBfeCD98E4D297Db`
    :::
    
    We can create any number of subdomains just like web domain addresses. We will use subdomains concept to point to our static 
    website using IPFS at later stage. We have now completed the first part of our mission.

## Hosting a static site with IPFS

Now that we have registered an ENS name, let's create and host a static web page and host it on IPFS.

An IPFS client needs to be installed to communicate with the IPFS swarm. The installation of the client is pretty 
straightforward. Installation instructions for Linux, Mac and Windows can be found [here](https://simpleaswater.com/installing-ipfs/).

Make sure the you have the recent version of IPFS client once the installation is complete.

```
koshik@koshik ~/D/p/ipfs> ipfs version
ipfs version 0.5.1
```

We need to now run a local IPFS daemon so that we can communicate with the other nodes.

```jsx {1}
koshik@koshik ~/D/p/ipfs> ipfs daemon

Initializing daemon...

```

Let's create a basic Hello World website to upload it to the IPFS nodes. Create the following files under the `hello`
directory.

```
hello/
├── index.html
└── style.css
```


```jsx title="hello/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Hello World! IPFS + ENS</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <span>Hosting on IPFS and ENS</span>
</body>
</html>

```

```jsx title="hello/style.css"
h1 {
  color: #3f51b5;
}
```

Both of these files under `hello` directory can be added to the IPFS listing locally with the following command:
It will publish the files to the local IPFS node and display the IPFS hash value of each files.

``` jsx {1}
ipfs add -r hello/
added QmcMsW8CUPJBDpBAE9uxH5B57gED3SuHzhYVzhYLpQ9ZzE hello/index.html
added QmazEzEvcnQ6QRdMCMYPMFphen85G93x7qKpxgeCH2FFmu hello/style.css
added QmT3LNMyQ1fnsKHHz5RQkHWG84CeAEQEKToXeuJ3x6JdWD hello
 272 B / 272 B [=======================================================] 100.00%
```
We should now be able to view the website on our browser. Just paste the IPFS hash value of the `hello` directory to the address bar of the browser:

```
https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmT3LNMyQ1fnsKHHz5RQkHWG84CeAEQEKToXeuJ3x6JdWD
```

We will be greeted with the following page as expected. This page may be rendered by our local IPFS node until the 
files are uploaded to a few of the peers of the IPFS swarm.

![ipfs-local-page](/img/ipfs-ens/ipfs-local-page.png)

Voila! We have successfully hosted our website on the IPFS distributed network. We are still missing the last piece. That is
mapping our website to a ENS name so that we can view our website through a friendly name. We shall do that next.

## Linking the hosted IPFS site to the ENS domain

A file or set of files hosted on a distributed storage network can be mapped to a an identifier or name. But the mechanism 
should also promise the mapping to persist even if there is an update to the files on the IPFS network. IPFS provides
the mapping mechanism with the help of IPNS or DNSLink in a IPFS gateway.
IPNS creates `peerId` for the IPFS hash so that subsequent versions of the IPFS content can still be accessed with 
the help of this `peerId`. Where as, DNSLink allows to create a more readable name to access the IPFS content through 
gateways. Read more on this [here](https://simpleaswater.com/hosting-website-using-ipfs/).

We will not use IPNS to create a mapping to our static website, instead, we shall use the ENS domain which was created 
earlier.

1. As a first step, let's go to our ENS name dashboard and navigate to the `Subdomains` tab and click on the <Highlight color="#1877F2">**Add Subdomain**</Highlight> button.

2. Let's create a new subdomain label named hello. Click on the save and sign the MetaMask transaction.

    ![ens-subdomain](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-subdomain.png)

3. Once the previous transaction is confirmed, we can now go to the subdomain page add our IPFS hash of our static website in the RECORDS
    section at the bottom of the page. Make sure to select the `CONTENT` from the dropdown list. The IPFS hash in our case is
    `QmT3LNMyQ1fnsKHHz5RQkHWG84CeAEQEKToXeuJ3x6JdWD`. Save and confirm the transaction.
    ![ens-ipfs-link](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-ipfs-link.png)
    
That is it !!!. Once the transaction is confirmed you can visit your subdomain address on your favourite browser by adding `.link` at the end.
That is `hello.koshik.eth.link` in our case. Voila! you will be greeted with our brand new website hosted on the IPFS network with ENS domain.

![ens-ipfs-site](/img/ipfs-ens/ens-ipfs-site.png)

That's it for this post. I shall add more interesting posts on ENS and IPFS. Cheers!
